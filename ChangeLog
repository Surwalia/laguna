                     Brief history of LAGUNA package 

1.0 - 2.0 
    LAG package maintained by Richard Rossmanith. 

2.1 * Obsolete operation `BasisByGeneratorsNC' replaced by `BasisNC'
      (lib/lag.gi)
    * Version changed (init.g)
      - ideally init.g should read VERSION (so it need only be changed in
        one place), but the commented out method to do this needs to be
        verified that it works on Windows and Macintosh
    * Split off ReadPkg of .gi file into read.g
    * Tidied up README.lag
    * Added VERSION, ChangeLog
    * All other changes made were to improve the documentation
      - (non-empty) doc/manual.bib added 
      - doc/Makefile now has targets for manual.ps, manual.pdf, htm
      - Updated examples for GAP 4.3 (doc/lag.msk)
      - Markup changes so that bibliography and HTML version now possible
        (doc/{lag.msk,manual.tex},lib/lag.gd)

    -- Greg Gamble - 21 April, 2002.

3.0 * New name: LAGUNA (Lie AlGebras and UNits of group Algebras)
    * Documentation written in GAPDoc format
    * added banner.g, functions moved from laguna.gi to laguna.g
    * added TODO.laguna
    * added PkgInfo.g for new package loading mechanism in GAP.dev
    * new properties and attributes of group rings:
      - IsGroupAlgebra
      - IsFmodularGroupAlgebra
      - IsPModularGroupAlgebra
      - UnderlyingGroup
      - UnderlyingRing
      - UnderlyingField
    * New attributes of group rings elements:
      - Support
      - CoefficientsBySupport
      - TraceOfMagmaRingElement
      - Length
      - Augmentation
      - IsUnit (improves existing in GAP 4.3)
      - InverseOp (improves existing in GAP 4.3)
    * Operation `Involution' for involutions of group ring elements
      (both classical and induced by a mapping of order two)
    * Attributes describing the structure of augmentation ideal of
      modular group algebras of finite p-groups:
      - WeightedBasis
      - AugmentationIdealPowerSeries
      - AugmentationIdealNilpotencyIndex
      - AugmentationIdealOfDerivedSubgroupNilpotencyIndex
      - RadicalOfAlgebra (improves existing in GAP 4.3)
    * New properties for groups generated by units of a group ring
      and their pc presentations:
      - IsGroupOfUnitsOfMagmaRing
      - IsUnitGroupOfGroupRing
      - IsNormalizedUnitGroupOfGroupRing
    * Calculation of the (normalized) unit group of the modular group
      algebra of the finite p-group and its pc presentation:
      - NormalizedUnitGroup
      - PcNormalizedUnitGroup
      - Units (improves existing in GAP 4.3)
      - PcUnits
      with one-to-one correspondence between the original group and
      its pc presentation established via:
      - NaturalBijectionToNormalizedUnitGroup
      - NaturalBijectionToPcNormalizedUnitGroup
    * An attribute UnderlyingGroupRing for the groups of units to 
      remember the initial group ring, setted while construction of the 
      (normalized) unit groups and their pc presentations.
    * An attribute GroupBases, storing representatives of conjugacy classes
      of group bases of the modular group algebra of a finite p-group 
    * Lie algebras section was taken from LAG 2.1 with small changes:
      - NaturalMapping was renamed to Embedding (more standard in GAP name)
      - for modular group algebras of finite p-groups new attributes 
        LieUpperNilpotencyIndex and LieLowerNilpotencyIndex were added
    * Added some attributes of groups, immportant in group rings theory:
      - DimensionBasis
      - LieDimensionSubgroups  
      - DihedralDepth
    * Defined new info class - LAGInfo with info levels 0, 1, 2 and 3

    -- Victor Bovdi, Alexander Konovalov, Csaba Schneider, March 2003.

3.1 * Accepted version of the LAGUNA package (June 2003) 
      - improved documentation
      - optimized Augmentation code
      - added IsSymmetric and IsUnitary

3.2 * Fully compatibile with the new package loading mechanism of GAP 4.4
      (July 2003)

3.2.1 * Interface improvements (July 2003):
        - Added InfoLevel 4 and made InfoLevel 1 the default one
        - Mentioned LAGUNA in method's descriptions for better tracing

3.2.2 * Minor updates for coming GAP 4.4 release (April 2004):
        - making sure that Augmentation(x) is in the underlying ring
        - checking whether x=0 in IsUnit(x)
